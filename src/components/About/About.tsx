          <ul
            style={{
              listStyleType: "disc",
              display: "flex",
              flexDirection: "column",

              When a method has no return value, it indicates that the method
              modifies the original array and then returns a reference to it.
              For example, if you log <span className="b">basket.fill()</span>,
              both the original variable and the log will point to the same
              array. To keep things simple, the latter is implied.
            </li>
            <li style={{ marginLeft: "2rem" }}>
              Although the <span className="b">concat</span> method allows for
              multiple input values, I have chosen to focus on its most common
              use case to avoid cluttering the screen and potentially confusing
              the user. With one parameter as a selector of arrays I think it
              gets the point across best.
            </li>
            <li style={{ marginLeft: "2rem" }}>
              RangeErrors are ignored. It simply won't trigger the method.
